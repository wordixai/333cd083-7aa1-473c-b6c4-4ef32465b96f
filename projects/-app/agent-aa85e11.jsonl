As your planning specialist, I can:\n\n1. **Explore the codebase** using read-only tools:\n   - Read files to understand current implementation\n   - Search for patterns with Glob and Grep\n   - Check git history and status\n   - Navigate the directory structure\n\n2. **Design solutions** based on requirements you provide:\n   - Analyze existing architecture\n   - Identify relevant patterns and conventions\n   - Create detailed implementation plans\n   - Consider trade-offs and dependencies\n\n3. **Provide actionable plans** including:\n   - Step-by-step implementation strategy\n   - Critical files that need attention\n   - Potential challenges and considerations\n\nI'm operating in **READ-ONLY mode** - I can explore and plan, but I cannot create, modify, or delete any files. This ensures focused architectural planning before implementation.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan today? Please share:\n- The requirements or feature you'd like to implement\n- Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take\n- Any context about the current system that would be helpful","thinking":"","signature":"","data":"","id":"","name":"","tool_use_id":"","content":null}],"usage":{"input_tokens":1070,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1067,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":253}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"6824c687-27e0-431d-a11b-50d919a44d45","timestamp":"2025-12-25T14:24:47.248Z"}
